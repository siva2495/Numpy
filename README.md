# Numpy Library Basics
NumPy library in Python

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:
•	A powerful N-dimentional array object
•	Sophisticated (Broadcasting) functions
•	Tools for integrating C/C++ and fortran code
•	Useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and randam number capabilities

Difference between numpy array and list
•	Data type should be same of all the elements in a numpy array whereas it can be different in case of lists.
•	Broadcasting: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.broadcasting.html
•	if we add an element of string data type in a numpy array
•	then it will upcast the data type to string of all the elements
•	If we create one sample list and numpy array and apply a very basic function of multiplication by 2. We will see that in case of list the elements are duplicated and appended to the list whereas in case of numpy array we got an array where all elements are multiplied by 2.
